# SURVE
___


### Concept:

Most students, researchers, and marketers face the challenge of motivating an audience to participate in questionnaires/surveys. It is difficult to obtain participation without providing a meaningful incentive. Luckily, SURVE offers an innovative solution to this issue thanks to kin coin cryptocurrency. With SURVE, qualified users would be given the opportunity to earn by completing surveys posted by the researchers. For users wanting to post surveys, they would have to spend proportionally (by brackets) to the number of respondents they desire.

Naturally, many of the users of this program would be students - especially those at the university level. And so, to complement the experience mentioned so far, users would also be able to earn by sharing useful documents such as past exams, notes and solutions to problems (where legal). Participants of this system would be required to spend kin, some of which would go to the uploader, to view the full document they want to see. This system provides easier access to information than other sites that charge students monthly fees to access critical documents.

### Money Matters:

 But will this app make money? Absolutely. Using the Pollfish SDK, users would be given a limited number of short paid surveys - ideally once a day - that would be presented as a streak challenge. Users would be rewarded in kin for maintaining a streak of responding consistently to the short paid surveys provided by Pollfish. This is expected to encourage user retention while providing revenue for the SURVE development team. This revenue will go towards further promotion of the app, acquiring talent and continued motivation of the team.
