# SURVE
___


### Concept:

Most students, researchers, and marketers face the challenge of motivating an audience to participate in questionnaires/surveys. It is difficult to obtain participation without providing a meaningful incentive. Luckily, SURVE offers an innovative solution to this issue thanks to the Kin coin initiative. With SURVE, qualified users would be given the opportunity to earn by completing the surveys posted by other SURVE users. For users wanting to publish their surveys, they would have to spend Kin proportionally to the number of respondents they desire.

Given the nature of this app it is likely that many of the users of this program would be students - especially those at the university level. And so, to complement the experience mentioned so far, users would also be able to earn by sharing useful documents such as past exams, notes, and questions and solutions to course-related problems (legally, of course). Consumers in this exchange would be required to spend kin, a percentage of which goes to the uploader, to view the full document they want to see. These transactions provide easier access to information than other sites that charge students monthly fees to access such necessary documents.

### Money Matters:

 Now, will this app also make money? Absolutely. Using the Pollfish SDK, users would be given a limited number of short paid surveys - ideally once a day - that would be presented as a streak challenge. Users would be rewarded in kin for maintaining a streak of responding consistently to the short paid surveys provided by Pollfish. This is expected to encourage user retention while providing revenue for the SURVE development team. This revenue will go towards further promotion of the app, acquiring talent and continued motivation of the team.

### The Future of SURVE:

Among the plans for SURVE as the company grows, is the goal to reserve a warehouse such that we would reward users for donating their textbooks. Then we would post them as offers to other SURVE users at reasonable costs. We are confident that this initiative would be supported by many students, or people in any field for that matter, as it would save them large sums of money.
